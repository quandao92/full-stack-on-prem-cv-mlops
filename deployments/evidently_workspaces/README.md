Inside JupyterLab, this location is mounted with `evidently_db` volume. So, you can manipulate Evidently projects/reports/test suites here.

**Note:** At the time of development of this project, Evidently had just released a new feature called “Collector service”. It seemed pretty useful and could serve the same purpose as Prefect Worker for collecting and computing reports in our project, but the doc was still very limited and marked as **“Alpha”**. We also don’t understand thoroughly how it works; mainly how the service stores data and how to connect it with db. We decided not to go that way and use more mature and reliable approach which is Prefect & Prefect Worker. Anyways, it could be one of the improvement in the future as it looked pretty interesting to setup the whole monitoring system with Evidently ecosystem.
